# AI-Based Fashion Recommendation System

This project is an AI-powered solution for clothing classification and fashion recommendations. It is designed to help online fashion platforms improve product discovery and user experience using deep learning.

We trained a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale clothing images from the Fashion MNIST PNG dataset into 10 categories like T-shirts, dresses, trousers, and shoes. The model achieved high accuracy and strong performance on test data.

For recommendations, we used a ResNet50 feature extractor and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find visually similar items. This allows the system to suggest outfits based on image similarity without needing user data or manual tags.

The system supports:
- Image classification for fashion categories  
- Content-based recommendations using deep visual features  
- Enhanced search, tagging, and outfit suggestions  

## Dataset Used
- Fashion MNIST PNG (70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories)

## Techniques
- CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Data Augmentation & Early Stopping
- Feature Extraction with ResNet50
- K-Nearest Neighbors for image similarity

This work is ideal for students, researchers, and developers working in computer vision, e-commerce, or recommendation systems.
